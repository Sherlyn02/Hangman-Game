# Hangman-Game
The Hangman game is a classic word puzzle game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" figure is drawn, and the player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

# Languages and Technologies:

HTML: Used for structuring the game interface.
CSS: Used for styling the game, creating the hangman figure display, and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Used for implementing the game logic, word selection, input validation, and managing user interactions.

# How to Play:

The player starts a new game.
A hidden word is chosen, and the hangman figure display is empty.
The player enters a single letter and submits their guess.
If the letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position(s). If not, the hangman figure is updated.
The player continues guessing until they either guess the word correctly or run out of allowed incorrect guesses.
The game ends with a win or a loss, and the player can choose to restart.
A Hangman game is an engaging and fun way to test your vocabulary and deduction skills. You can customize and expand upon this basic description to create a more feature-rich and visually appealing game.
